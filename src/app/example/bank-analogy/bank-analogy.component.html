      <p>Think of the NgRx Store like a Bank.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Store</strong> is the Bank — a central, secure place that holds your data (like the bank holds your money).</p>
      <p>The <strong>State</strong> in the store is like the account balance — it contains your information.</p>
      <p>Multiple customers (or parts of your application) can interact with the bank, but no one can directly take or put money into it.</p>
      <p>Even though it's your money, you cannot directly credit or debit your account. You must follow specific procedures like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Filling a deposit form or</li>
        <li>Submitting a withdrawal request</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These forms are like <strong>Actions</strong> in NgRx.</p>
      <p>And just like the bank has a teller or a system to process your request, NgRx has a <strong>Reducer</strong> that handles the action and updates the state immutably — meaning it creates a new version of the state, rather than modifying it directly.</p>
